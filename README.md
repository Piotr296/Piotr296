Hello There!

I am a Data Scientist specializing in spatial data. The main area of my interests is numerical processing and analysis of geographical information, machine learning and big data.

In 2019 I graduated in Geodesy and Cartography at the Warsaw University of Technology. I defended my diploma by creating an algorithm that converts spatial data into a point cloud, which I then implemented into the popular Minecraft game. From that moment, I decided to combine my knowledge of spatial data with the ability to process them on a large scale, machine learning and programming. Then I continued my education studying Data Science at IT University of Copenhagen and Geoinformatics at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, where I was also a member of the TECH Talents programme. Currently, I work in the offshore industry, where I design and implement ETL systems, manage databases and cloud resources, and develop services based on spatial data.

Technologies and skills: Python, SQL, Microsoft Azure, Power BI, MS Excel, FME, QGIS, ArcGIS, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Spatial Databases, Data Enginnering.
